reddit.tv for tvOS

This is more of a proof of concept than anything else. With no WKWebView or UIWebView on tvOS, it's impossible to show YouTube videos in a manner consistent with YouTube's TOS. 

The project uses [HCYouTubeParser](https://github.com/hellozimi/HCYoutubeParser) to attain the desired result. Fork or use at your own risk.
